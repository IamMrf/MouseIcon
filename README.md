# MouseIconPack

Hi! thank you for use my cursors.

## Installation: 
To install the cursor you want, go to the "dark" or "light" folder. Inside, open the "Cursor" folder, where you’ll find a file named "install." Right-click on this file and select "install" from the menu. If you’re on Windows 11, you’ll need to click "More options" first to see the "install" option. I hope you enjoy them!
